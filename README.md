# SakuraKit: Swift SDK for Prototyping AI Speech Generation

SakuraKit is a Swift SDK designed to quickly prototyping speech-to-speech or text-to-speech using different APIs to build low-latency, multimodal experiences with ease. 

This SDK is named after the cherry blossoms (Sakura) to enjoy in Shibuya next year. ðŸŒ¸

## Basic Usage

Here is a quick example to get you started:

```swift
import SakuraKit

// Initialize the SakuraKit client
let playAI = PlayAI(apiKey: "your_playht_api_key", userId: "your_user_id")

// Create a PlayNote for generating audio from PDF:
let request = PlayNoteRequest(
sourceFileUrl: sourceURL,
synthesisStyle: .podcast,
voice1: .angelo,
voice2: .nia
)

let response = try await playAI.createPlayNote(request)
```

Available voice styles include:
- Podcast conversations
